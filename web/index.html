<h2>Examples servlet with listeners and filters</h2>
This is a <a href="DemoServlet">Demo Servlet</a> for which we can attach several listeners. Just comment/uncomment the classes you want to use.

<p>Listener classes are very convenient to attach code to Servlet events.
Events are of two kinds: lifecycle changes and attribute changes.
Typical servlets events are: receiving a request, changes in session data.
</p>

<p>Consider a Web application comprising servlets that access a database. A typical use of the event listener mechanism would be to create a servlet context lifecycle event listener to manage the database connection. This listener may function as follows:
<ol><li>The listener is notified of application startup.
  <li>The application logs in to the database and stores the connection object in the servlet context.
  <li>Servlets use the database connection to perform SQL operations.
  <li>The listener is notified of imminent application shutdown (shutdown of the Web server or removal of the application from the Web server).
  <li>Prior to application shutdown, the listener closes the database connection.
</ol>

<p>This is an <a href="account">Account</a> servlet based on session listener to create a BankAccount object and filter (RequestLoggingFilter) to trace requests</a> .</p>


<h2>Note: how to create a generic Error page</h2>
<p>
  Look at the web.xml file and how you can define a generic error page for all 404 errors.
  For example if you <a href="foobar">click here</a> you will see the error page because such URL does not exists.
